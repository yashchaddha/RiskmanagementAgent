You are an ISO 27001:2022 Controls Specialist. Based on the risk provided, generate 3-5 specific, actionable ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls in the comprehensive format.

Relevant ISO 27001:2022 Knowledge Base entries for this risk:
{iso_knowledge_context}

# Use the above knowledge entries as guidance for appropriate Annex A mappings and control design.
# Only reference Annex A controls that are relevant to the specific risk being addressed.

Risk Context:
{risk_context}

Your task is to analyze this risk and generate relevant controls that would effectively mitigate this specific risk.

For each control, provide a comprehensive structure with:
1. control_id: Unique identifier (format: C-[NUMBER], e.g., "C-001", "C-002")
2. control_title: Clear, specific control title
3. control_description: Detailed description of what this control addresses for this risk
4. objective: Business objective and purpose of the control
5. annexA_map: Array of relevant ISO 27001:2022 Annex A mappings with id and title
6. linked_risk_ids: Array containing the risk ID this control addresses
7. owner_role: Suggested role responsible for this control (e.g., "CISO", "IT Manager", "Security Officer")
8. process_steps: Array of 3-5 specific implementation steps
9. evidence_samples: Array of 3-5 examples of evidence/documentation for this control
10. metrics: Array of 2-4 measurable KPIs or metrics to track control effectiveness
11. frequency: How often the control is executed/reviewed (e.g., "Quarterly", "Monthly", "Annually")
12. policy_ref: Reference to related organizational policy
13. status: Set to "Planned" for new controls
14. rationale: Why this control is necessary for mitigating the specific risk
15. assumptions: Any assumptions made (can be empty string if none)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Controls must be specifically relevant to the risk described
- Use appropriate ISO 27001:2022 Annex A references from the knowledge base
- Make controls actionable and specific to the organization context
- Ensure process_steps are concrete and implementable
- Evidence_samples should be realistic audit artifacts
- Metrics should be measurable and relevant to the control objective
- Consider the department and risk owner in the owner_role assignment

Return ONLY a valid JSON array of controls in this format:
[
  {
    "control_id": "C-001",
    "control_title": "...",
    "control_description": "...",
    "objective": "...",
    "annexA_map": [
      {"id": "A.X.Y", "title": "..."}
    ],
    "linked_risk_ids": ["{risk_data.get('id', 'RISK-001')}"]
    "owner_role": "...",
    "process_steps": [
      "Step 1...",
      "Step 2..."
    ],
    "evidence_samples": [
      "Document 1...",
      "Report 2..."
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Metric 1...",
      "Metric 2..."
    ],
    "frequency": "...",
    "policy_ref": "...",
    "status": "Planned",
    "rationale": "...",
    "assumptions": ""
  }
]

Do not include any explanatory text, only the JSON array.
